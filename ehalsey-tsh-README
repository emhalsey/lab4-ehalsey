COMPILING AND RUNNING THIS PROGRAM:

1) Connect to pi.cs.oswego.edu

2) Ensure all the files (listed below) are in the same folder, and your current directory is set to that folder.

  i) You can check your current directory by typing "pwd"

3) Compile the program and the helpers by writing the following:

  MAIN
  gcc -Wall -O2 -o tsh ehalsey-tsh.c

  HELPERS
  gcc -Wall -O2 -o myspin   myspin.c
  gcc -Wall -O2 -o mysplit  mysplit.c
  gcc -Wall -O2 -o mystop   mystop.c
  gcc -Wall -O2 -o myint    myint.c

  i) Compilation explanation:
      gcc: The compiler used on pi.cs.oswego.edu
      -Wall: enables common warnings, helpful for debugging
      -O2: level 2 optimization, often used in production. Balances between speed and compile time
      -o _____: the output file name. Called "ehalsey-tsh.c" "tsh" since this is what the test cases refer to it as.

4) Check permissions for everything

  i) Make sure all the needed components exist and check permissions executable:
      ls -l sdriver.pl tsh myspin mysplit mystop myint tshref

      COMPONENTS
      a) sdriver.pl: driver needed to run shell
      b) tsh: my shell
      c) myspin mysplit mystop myint: the helper binaries
      d) tshref: the reference shell

      My permissions initially looked like this for a) and d): -rw-r--r--
      Only read/write for owner, read for others, and no execution.

      The permissions for b) and c) were fine since I was the one that compiled them.
      In the rare case that the permissions look like the above, follow the same steps below for b) and c) as well.

  ii) Run this to make a) and d) executable:
      chmod +x sdriver.pl tshref

  iii) Check permissions again to make sure
      ls -l sdriver.pl tsh myspin mysplit mystop myint tshref

      Permissions should now look like this for everything: -rwxr-xr-x

5) Run all the tests (1-16) by writing make test##

    make test01
    make test02
    ...
    make test16

    i) If there are no error messages, the test has passed.
    ii) You can check for sure by typing "echo $?". If it prints 0, it passed.
    iii) Compare the output to the reference shell by typing "make rtest##".

        make rtest01
        make rtest02
        ...
        make rtest16

    iv) To see detailed test execution, add -v:
        ./sdriver.pl -t trace05.txt -s ./tsh -a "-p" -v
