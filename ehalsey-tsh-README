COMPILING AND RUNNING THIS PROGRAM:

1) Connect to pi.cs.oswego.edu

2) Ensure all the files (listed below) are in the same folder, and your current directory is set to that folder.

  i) You can check your current directory by typing "pwd"

3) Check sdriver.pl permissions

  i) Make sure it exists and is executable:
      ls -l sdriver.pl

      My permissions initially looked like this: -rw-r--r--
      Only read/write for owner, read for others, and no execution.

  ii) Run this to make it executable:
      chmod +x sdriver.pl

      Permissions should look like this: -rwxr-xr-x

4) Compile the program AND the helper binaries by writing the following:

  MAIN
  gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o tsh ehalsey-tsh.c

  HELPERS
  gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o myspin   myspin.c
  gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o mysplit  mysplit.c
  gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o mystop   mystop.c
  gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o myint    myint.c

  i) Compilation explanation:
      gcc: The compiler used on pi.cs.oswego.edu
      -Wall: enables common warnings, helpful for debugging
      -Wextra: enables additional warnings beyond -Wall like unused function parameters and signed vs. unsigned comparisons
      -O2: level 2 optimization, often used in production. Balances between speed and compile time
      -o tsh: the output file name. Called tsh since this is what the test cases call it.

5) Check after compiling:

  i) Make sure they exist and are executable:
        ls -l tsh myspin mysplit mystop myint
  
        Permissions should look like this for all of them: -rwxr-xr-x
  
    ii) If not, run this to make them executable:
        chmod +x tsh myspin mysplit mystop myint
  
        This will ensure they are all executable.

6) Run all the tests (1-16) by writing make test##

    make test01
    make test02
    ...
    make test16

    i) If there are no error messages, the test has passed.
    ii) You can check for sure by typing "echo $?". If it prints 0, it passed.
    iii) Compare the output to the reference shell by typing "make rtest##".
        make rtest01
        make rtest02
        ...
        make rtest16
